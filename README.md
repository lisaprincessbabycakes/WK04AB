# Week 04

Finishing up loops and stars... starting randomness and interactions....


### A:
Added a parameter to `star()` function to allow for different number of legs/arms.

### B:
Added a third dimension of `for()` loop to create concentric squares.

Then, used `rotate()` to change each of the concentric squares.

### C:
Used `random()` to pick surprise sizes for our squares and add small variations to their location.

### D:
Experimented with all possibilities of `random()` to pick random shapes, colors and sizes.

Also, added a little bit of interaction with the [`mousePressed()`](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/mousePressed/) function.
